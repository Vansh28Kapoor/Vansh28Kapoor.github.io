    <img width="400" src="/img/detect.gif">
</p>
   
As a part of the endterm project for the course, developed a rapid real-time multi-face detector. It utilizes the modern technique of “Integral
Image Representation” for rapid computation of Haar features, subsequently used by Adaboost for classifier learning. Integrated the model with a live webcam,
enabling real-time face detection. [Read More](/projects/Multi-face)

4. **BIOMEDICAL IMAGE SEGMENTATION USING DEEP LEARNING** [Github](https://github.com/Vansh28Kapoor/BIOMEDICAL-IMAGE-SEGMENTATION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING)        
  [_EE 610: Image Processing_](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/course_lists/ee-768-introduction-to-machine-learning/), [_Prof. Amit Sethi_](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/)  


<p align="center">
    <img width="300" height="250" src="/img/img_segmentation.gif">
</p>

Coded a U-Net architecture tailored for binary semantic segmentation for distinguishing between nucleus and non-nucleus regions in stained tissue images by employing TensorFlow+Keras. Finally, applied watershed segmentation on the probability map produced by UNet for segmentation of individual nuclei, demonstrating its effectiveness on test images containing overlapping or touching nuclei.

5. **MULTI-FACETED IMAGE RESTORATION AND ENHANCEMENT** [Github](https://github.com/Vansh28Kapoor/MULTI-FACETED-IMAGE-RESTORATION-AND-ENHANCEMENT){: .btn--github}

<p align="center">
    <img width="300" height="300" src="/img/restore.gif">
</p>

 Wide ranging and challenging problem statements which dealt with implementing a research-based technique properties of neighbouring wavelet coefficients for image denoising, image restoration of motion-blurred cars to effectively reveal license plate characters and satellite image enhancement.

 6. **ALGORITHMIC DESIGN OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS**  
[ _EE 341: Communication Systems Lab_ ](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/course_lists/ee-341-communication-systems-i/), [_Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair_](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/)  

<p align="center">
    <img width="400" src="/img/costas.png">
</p>

Evaluated the performance of Costas Loop and Viterbi-Viterbi algorithms in discrete-time for phase and frequency offset removal in incoming signals using GNU Radio. Implemented equalization filter design to negate the effect of ISI (Intersymbol Interference) on the digitally transmitted message suffering multipath reflection with the help of GNU Radio. Performed practical analysis of analog carrier modulation schemes (DSB, DSB-SC, and SSB) using an IQ modulator board by observing the received spectrum using GNU Radio and a dongle.

</p>

Explored various results on Bipartite consensus of general linear multi-agent systems and Bipartite consensus in networks of agents with antagonistic interactions by Performing thorough literature review. The objective is on finding out the condition for the existence of the control parameter K for which Bi-partite Consensus is possible when the agents are all linear systems with different state-space representations
