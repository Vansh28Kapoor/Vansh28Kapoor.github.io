5. **BIOMEDICAL IMAGE SEGMENTATION USING DEEP LEARNING** [Github](https://github.com/Vansh28Kapoor/BIOMEDICAL-IMAGE-SEGMENTATION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING){: .btn--github}      
  [_EE 610: Image Processing, Autumn 2022_](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/course_lists/ee-768-introduction-to-machine-learning/), [_Prof. Amit Sethi_](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/)  
  ![Watershed Segmentation](/images/img_segmentation.png){: width="400" }  
Coded a U-Net architecture tailored for binary semantic segmentation for distinguishing between nucleus and non-nucleus regions in stained tissue images by employing TensorFlow+Keras. Finally, applied watershed segmentation on the probability map produced by UNet for segmentation of individual nuclei, demonstrating its effectiveness on test images containing overlapping or touching nuclei.

  ![Image](/images/restore.png){: width="400" }   
 Wide ranging and challenging problem statements which dealt with implementing a research-based technique properties of neighbouring wavelet coefficients for image denoising, image restoration of motion-blurred cars to effectively reveal license plate characters and satellite image enhancement.

 7. **ALGORITHMIC DESIGN OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS**  
[ _EE 341: Communication Systems Lab, Autumn 2022_ ](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/course_lists/ee-341-communication-systems-i/), [_Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair_](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/)  
  ![RISC MultiState High Level](/images/costas.png){: width="700" }  
Evaluated the performance of Costas Loop and Viterbi-Viterbi algorithms in discrete-time for phase and frequency offset removal in incoming signals using GNU Radio. Implemented equalization filter design to negate the effect of ISI (Intersymbol Interference) on the digitally transmitted message suffering multipath reflection with the help of GNU Radio. Performed practical analysis of analog carrier modulation schemes (DSB, DSB-SC, and SSB) using an IQ modulator board by observing the received spectrum using GNU Radio and a dongle.
