## 1. Partially Observable MDPs with State Sensing Cost 
_Research project with [Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair ](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/)_    

In many practical sequential decision-making problems, there is an additional cost associated with sensing a state. I worked on such a problem for a discounted cost Partially Observable MDP. In this setting, an agent incurs an extra cost for sensing its current state but still has the freedom to take actions even without knowing its present state. A policy in this setting maps each state to a sequence of actions that an agent plays till sensing.  

In this setting, since each policy can map a state to a string of actions of possibly infinite length, i.e., there is no limit on the number of possible policies. I designed a computationally efficient algorithm and formulated theorems to calculate the optimal policy within any specified error threshold by exploring a finite set of policies. I validated these theoretical results also via numerical simulations.  

In recognition of the contributions made through this research, I was awarded the *Undergraduate Research Award (URA01)* from IIT Bombay. We are currently working on its pre-print and aim to have it finalized by February.

## 2. Early Rumor Detection 
_In collaboration with Google AI research, along with [Dr. Manish Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manish-jain-kj2020/) and [Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani](https://sites.google.com/site/nikhilkaram/)_  


I got an opportunity to collaborate with Google AI Research to design effective models for for analyzing the spread of various contagion processes on social networks. Our project focuses on countering coordinated bot attacks aimed at spreading rumors across different social media platforms like YouTube.  We are employing Online Learning techniques to assess the credibility of individual users within the social network and subsequently applying deep learning-based cascade models to enable more precise  management of information dissemination.
