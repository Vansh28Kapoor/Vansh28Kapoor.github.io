## 1. Partially Observable MDPs with State Sensing Cost 
_Research project with [Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair ](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/)_.  

In many practical sequential decision-making problems, there is an additional cost associated with sensing a state. We consider a setting where an agent incurs this extra cost for sensing its current state but still has the freedom to take actions even without knowing its present state. A policy in this setting maps each state to a sequence of actions that an agent plays till sensing.


I worked on the analysis of 3-party multi-secret sharing schemes under specific scenarios of the problem. I looked for optimal schemes and tested the optimality by bounding the randomness complexity required to facilitate secret sharing. We extended these information-theoretic bounds to all possible combinations of binary secrets and presented combinatorial bounds in cases where the lower bound was loose.  

Our paper titled *"[Randomness Requirements for Three-Secret Sharing](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT54713.2023.10206455)"* was presented at [ISIT 2023](https://isit2023.org/).
