Hey! I am Vansh, a final year Undergraduate at [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/index.php), [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). I am pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Electrical Engineering along with Honors. My enthusiasm greatly lies in exploring the realm of applied probability and stochastic theory. More specifically, I am inclined towards applications of concepts such as Reinforcement Learning, Queuing Theory, Multi-Arm Bandits and Game Theory to optimize Computer Networks and Digital Communication.


Currently I am working with Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair on a special case of discounted cost [POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes)](/research). At the moment, I am also actively engaged as a Teaching Assistant for a course I deeply enjoy: Error Correcting Codes, taught by Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani.

Apart from that I love solving brain teasers and puzzles and I always find a way to incorporate it into my schedule. I deeply enjoy playing Table tennis and watching cricket I find profound enjoyment in both playing table tennis and watching cricket, in fact both activities serve as stress relievers for me .
