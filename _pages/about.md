Hey! I’m Vansh Kapoor, a second-year Master's student in Machine Learning at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/). I completed my undergrad with Honors in Electrical Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay)](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/index.php). <!-- My enthusiasm lies in exploring the realm of Machine Learning and applied probability & statistics.--> I have also interned in RL & LLM reasoning @ [Amazon AI](https://www.amazon.science/) as an Applied Science (AI) Intern, and in hardware systems @ Google as a Hardware Intern.

I am passionate about developing principled and scalable ML algorithms for domains such as reinforcement learning and generative AI. Specifically, I am interested in research that integrates theoretical insights with practical applications in RL and its extensions to LLM reasoning/RLHF, Generative Modeling, Multi-Agent Learning & Game Theory.

I currently work with <a href="https://aviralkumar2907.github.io/">Prof. Aviral Kumar</a> and <a href="https://msimchowitz.github.io/">Prof. Max Simchowitz</a>. During my undergrad at IIT Bombay, I worked with <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair">Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair</a>, <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/vivek-shripad-borkar/">Prof. Vivek Borkar</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nikhilkaram/">Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani</a>. My research focused on a special case of discounted cost [Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes](/Research) (POMDPs), which earned me the *Undergraduate Research Award* from IIT Bombay and was accepted as a first-author paper to *AISTATS'26*.

<!-- For my Bachelor’s thesis, I collaborated with Google Research, where I closely worked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manish-jain-kj2020/">Dr. Manish Jain</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nikhilkaram/">Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani</a>  to develop online learning algorithms for nullifying coordinated bot attacks that spread rumors on social networks like YouTube. My designed algorithm outperformed existing greedy methods and scaled effectively to large networks. Additionally, I served as a teaching assistant for a graduate-level course in Error Correcting Codes, assisting with course preparation, grading, and holding weekly office hours for over 40 students. In the summer of 2023, I gained industry experience through an internship at Google as a Silicon Intern. There, I improved the design verification process by 15% using Python-based automation for toggle coverage analysis and developed automated checkers for data retention flops in low-power mode applications. -->

<!-- I have also worked on various [Deep Learning projects](/projects), including [Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Enhanced Semantic Understanding](/projects/SUR), [Deep Recurrent Q-Networks (DRQN) for Partially Observable MDPs](projects/DQRN), [CGAN-based Generative AI models & LSTM-based stock trading systems](/projects/AdvancedML), and [U-Net-based nuclei semantic segmentation](/projects/Image-Segmentation). -->

I love solving brain teasers and puzzles and I somehow try fitting them into my daily routine. I enjoy in both playing table tennis and watching cricket (more of a cricket follower rather than a player).
