Hey! I am Vansh, a final year Undergraduate at [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/index.php), [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). I am pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Electrical Engineering along with Honors. My enthusiasm lies in exploring the realm of applied probability and machine learning. More specifically, I am interested in the fields of Online Learning, Reinforcement Learning & Decision Making, Stochastic Modeling, Optimization and Game Theory.


Currently I am working with <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair">Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair</a> on a special case of discounted cost [POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes)](/Research). I am also collaborating with Google AI Research, where I am closely working with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manish-jain-kj2020/">Dr. Manish Jain</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nikhilkaram/">Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani</a>  to design effective models for understanding the spread of various contagion processes on social networks, particularly focusing on tackling coordinated bot attacks on social platforms. At the moment, I am also actively engaged as a Teaching Assistant for a course I deeply enjoy: Error Correcting Codes, taught by Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani.

Apart from that I love solving brain teasers and puzzles and I always find a way to incorporate it into my schedule. I enjoy playing Table tennis and watching cricket I find profound enjoyment in both playing table tennis and watching cricket, in fact both activities serve as stress relievers for me .

I love solving brain teasers and puzzles and I somehow try fitting them into my daily routine. I enjoy in both playing table tennis and watching cricket (more of a cricket follower rather than a player )
