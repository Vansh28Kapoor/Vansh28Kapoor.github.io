Conducted an intense literature review on the convex analytic method for infinite horizon average cost optimal stochastic control problems covering all its major results and its diverse applications in various fields. Delivered a detailed review incorporating its economic interpretations and intuitive explanations.

Explored various results on Bipartite consensus of general linear multi-agent systems and Bipartite consensus in networks of agents with antagonistic interactions.  Our objective is to find out the condition for the existence of the control parameter K for which Bi-partite Consensus is possible when the agents are all linear systems with different state-space representations.

Undertook a reading project on game theory to understand its versatile applications across domains such as communication networks and economics. Subsequently, delved into the realm of mechanism design, exploring the strategic craft of constructing games that incentivize and evoke favorable behavior among their participants
