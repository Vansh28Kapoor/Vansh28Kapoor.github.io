Raptor Codes are a widely embraced category of contemporary error-correcting codes that outperform ack-based protocols like TCP/IP on impaired channels and in multi-receiver and multi-transmitter scenarios. They offer an unlimited transmission rate that is limited solely by the encoding rate.

We simulated practical digital message transmission by implementing Raptor code encoding and decoding schemes from scratch, while modeling the Internet as a Binary Erasure Channel (BEC). Finally, we delivered a concise talk showcasing the significance of Raptor codes as a contemporary coding technique, encompassing comprehensive discussions on their performance metrics, and encoding/decoding algorithms.
